My name is Laura Lee Boyles, and I am currently a senior Computer Engineering student at Mississippi State University. I am originally from Ridgeland, Mississippi, and I plan to graduate college in the spring of 2024. When I graduate, I hope to work either in Huntsville, Alabama or in the Jackson area of Mississippi.
